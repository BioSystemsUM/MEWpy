# MEWpy

MEWpy is an integrated Metabolic Engineering Workbench for strain design optimization. It offers methods to explore different classes of constraint-based models (CBM) for:

- Simulation: allows to simulate  steady-state metabolic models, considering different formulations (e.g., GECKO, ETFL) and kinetic models;
- Omics data integration (eFlux, GIMME, iMAT);
- Optimization: performs Evolutionary Computation based strain design optimization by knocking out (KO) or over/under expressing (OU) reactions, genes or enzymes.

MEWPy currently supports [REFRAMED](https://github.com/cdanielmachado/reframed) and [COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) simulation environments. The optimization engine relies on either [inspyred](https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred) or [jMetalPy](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy) packages.

## Examples

Examples are provided as [jupyter notebooks](examples) and as [python scripts](examples).

## Documentation

The package documentation is available at [mewpy.readthedocs.io](https://mewpy.readthedocs.io).

## Instalation

Installing from Pypi package repository:

`pip install mewpy`

Installing from github:

1. clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/BioSystemsUM/mewpy.git -b master`

2. run `python setup.py install`

MEWPy requires a compatible linear programming solver, with installed Python dependencies, from the following list:

- [CPLEX](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-optimizer/) 
- [GUROBI](http://www.gurobi.com)
- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
