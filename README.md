# MEWpy

MEWpy is an integrated Metabolic Engineering Workbench, under development, for strain design optimization. Developed in Python, MEWpy offers methods to explore different classes of constraint-based models (CBM).

- Simulation: allows to simulate different metabolic models considering different phenotype.
- Optimization: performs Evolutionary Computation based strain design optimization by knocking out (KO) or over/under expressing (OU) reactions, genes or enzymes.

  **Metabolic Constraints**

  | Method       | Strategy |
  | ------------ | -------- |
  | Reactions    | KO / OU  |
  | Genes (GPRs) | KO / OU  |

  **Enzymatic Constraints**

  | Method                                                                                    | Strategy |

  | [GECKO](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20167411)                                            | KO / OU  |
  | [sMOMENT](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3329-9) | KO / OU  |

  **Regulatory Constraints**

  | Method                                                 | Strategy |

- MEWPy currently supports [REFRAMED](https://github.com/cdanielmachado/reframed) and [COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/) simulation environments.
- The optimization engine relies on either [inspyred](https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred) or [jMetalPy](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy) packages, which are used for creating biologically-inspired computational intelligence algorithms in Python.

- MEWpy may also be used to run simulation and optimization strategies on [Expression and Thermodynamics Flux](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006835) (ETFL).

- Next releases will be compatible with [Metabolism and Macromolecular Expression](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006302) (ME) models.
