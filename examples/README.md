MEWpy examples
============

  

This folder contains three examples on how MEWpy can be used for Computational Strain Optimization. 



The first example, [ROUProblem](ROUproblem.ipynb), illustrates how MEWpy may be used to identify reaction bounds modifications that favor the production of the aromatic amino acid (AAA) L-tyrosine in yeast.

The second example, [GOUProblem](GOUproblem.ipynb), aims to increase the production of the same AAA in E. coli by modifying genes expression.

The third example, [GeckoKOProblem](GeckoKOProblem.ipynb), also targets the same goal in yeast by exploiting a GECKO model and by deleting enzymatic proteins. 



More examples can be found in the MEWpy documentation https://mewpy.readthedocs.io.
